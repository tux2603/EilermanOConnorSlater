Make IT Wright Hackathon project

A simple AI that plays agar.io. Best time alive during testing was about 9 minutes. Dues to its use of the xwindows system, 
it will only work on linux. Additionally, firefox must be installed, with the bookmarks toolbar hidden. Tested on GNOME 
desktop, not garunteed to work on any other desktop system. KDE plasma is known to be buggy. Many 'magic numbers' were used 
for window size and button locations, so it will likely break as soon as agar.io updates their UI, but it would be relatively
easy to get it working again (ie, only an hour or so to find the new magic numbers)

That's all folks. It be working.
